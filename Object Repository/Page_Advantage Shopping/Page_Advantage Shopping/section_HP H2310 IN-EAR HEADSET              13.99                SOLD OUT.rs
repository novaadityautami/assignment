                            I really wish they came in other colors. Hot pink would match much better with my shirt.

                            They didn’t fit great. I had to take off my bike helmet to get them on.

                            The cable wasn’t very long. I couldn’t get to the bathroom with the earphones plugged in to my stereo.

                            I don’t get it – is 20 hours how long it takes to recharge the batteries or how long they last?

                            I really wish they came in other colors. Hot pink would match much better with my shirt.
